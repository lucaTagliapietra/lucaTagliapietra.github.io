I'm a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher at the Intelligent Autonomous System Laboratory (IASLab) of the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Padova.

I have a broad spectrum of reserach interests thightly or losely connected to the human-robot collaboration and to the promotion of a win-win paradigm in such cooperation. 

I recieved the Ph. D. in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Padova, supervised by Prof. Monica Reggiani. During the PhD, i was a visiting scholar for six months at the INSIGNEO institute for the In-Silico Medicine of the University of Sheffield (UK), under the supervision of Dr. Luca Modenese and Dr. Claudia Mazza.

I then moved to the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) as reserach fellow in Dynamic Interaction Control Group under the supervision of Dr. Francesco Nori and, lately, of Dr. Daniele Pucci.

After one year I took the opportunity to head back to the University of Padova, at the Department of Industrial Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Nicola Petrone and one year later, at the IASLab of the Department of Information Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Emanuele Menegatti.

## Main Research Interests

- *Human Motion Tracking and Modeling*: The real-time estimation of kinematics and dynamics of human motion in unstructured everyday working and living environments is an open challenge in different research fields. This research topic aims to develop a modular framework to accurately track and analyze human motion. The challenges are the use of the latest hardware technologies (such as IMUs, pressure sensors, EMGs, RGB-D cameras) and modeling software tools (such as OpenSim), their interconnection through a robotic middleware (ROS), and the development of new algorithms and methods to process data, extract information, and produce feedback from redundant and possibly overlapping systems.
- *Task and Motion Planning*: This research aim combines classical approaches with modern *Deep Reinforcement Learning* techniques to promote and endorse efficient human-robot cooperation in performing shared activities.
- *Knowledge-Based Task Planning*: The main idea behind this research topic is to exploit cloud computing capabilities and knowledge base advantages to boost multi-agent task planning problem resolution. Furthermore, efficient information storage and retrieval might significantly endorse task plan offline optimization and reuse (partial or complete according to task requirements and robots' capabilities and availability).
- *Ergonomics*: Outcomes of the first research stream have been recently used to identify, in real-time, potential safety risks for workers and/or estimate the benefits introduced by the use of *robotic exoskeletons*. This research aims to automatically adapt sensors, algorithms, and ergonomic scores to the working setups, thus improving human activity monitoring.
- *Accessible Rehabilitation*: Another research stream bridging real-time human motion estimation with wearable robotics is the rehabilitation of motion-impaired patients. Exploiting modern sensing and controlling technologies might indeed signigicantly boost the accessibility and realiability of rehabilitation treatments, thus enabling more and more patients to take out optimal benefits from their rehabilitation process.

Such a broad spectrum of research interests relies roots on strong mechatronics and computer science skills such as efficient and distributed C++ and Python programming together with good knowledge of sensing technologies.
